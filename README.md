# GlacierBackup

This is a small utility to backup different assets to Amazon Glacier.  This will initially
be used to help backup assets for my website, but should be more generally applicable for other
backup needs.  In addition to performing the upload to do the backup, an output file will be 
written which can track the amazon id and treehash for each file uploaded.
